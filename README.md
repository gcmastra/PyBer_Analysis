# PyBer_Analysis
When I am ready to submit this assignment I am also going to submit a survey. Since that may not happen for another week, I want to keep notes on how the class time went so I can include it in my survey.<br>

My comments for the week ending July 22 (Unit 5) are as follows:

## The Instructor:
Mike is doing a good job judging the expertise level of the class.  He seems to be aware there are some people who are ahead of the curve and some who are behind.
He is able to adjust his presentation to aim for the middle level of the class.  There is a lot of material to cover so he has to move quickly, but he always pauses
to ask if anyone has questions at the end of each demonstration.  He always has important and useful tips and pointers to supplement the class material. Based on feedback from the TAs in the breakout sessions, he judged correctly that it would be better to do the third breakout exercise as a group exercise with the full class.

## Comments on the online course materials
<UL>
  <li> The time estimates given at the start of the modules do not seem to be accurate. This was true in both Unit 4 and Unit 5.  Of course this is a self-paced class and the estimates given are general estimates.  If it takes me longer to finish some chapters than the estimate suggests, it might take someone else the same or less time.  Its not really a criticism as much as an observation.</li>
<li> The course materials themselves are very well crafted. The examples given are taken from potential real life situations a person might actually encounter on a job.</li>
